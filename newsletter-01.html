	<b>Do good and talk about it.</b> Yes, we are sending out a newsletter now. It will be about: platform developments, new features, upcoming changes, maybe some startup trivia and open source project involvements. We will send it whenever something important has happened, so maybe four times a year. We hope that you don't bother too much – we are a startup we have to communicate.

	PHP and Git from the Shell
</h1>
<p>
	We have upgraded our SSH interface. It is now possible to use Git directly from the shell and more important also use PHP directly. You can now use your frameworks CLI for example.
